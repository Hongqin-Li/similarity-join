## Installation

Change `PG_SOURCE_DIR`  to the path of the Postgres source code directory (e.g. `./postgresql-11.2/`), and `PG_DIR` to the path for installation(e.g. `$HOME/pgsql/`)

(This step is optional if you have installed Postgres) Then run the following command to automatically install Postgres to the destination directory (e.g. `$HOME/pgsql`).

```
bash setup.sh
```



## Usage

First, to run the back end server, run 

```
bash run_server.sh
```

Then we can connect to the server and start  by 

```
bash connect_db.sh
```
